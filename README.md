<img src="https://gitlab.com/SamDenton/dwm/-/raw/images/screenshot.jpg">

This is an installation script, it is intended to be ran right after using archinstall with the "xorg" profile. I do not recommend running this script on an existing install of arch. As of right now the script works perfectly fine however this project still a work in progress.

## Installation
```
git clone --depth 1 https://gitlab.com/SamDenton/samde.git
cd samde
./samde.sh
```
